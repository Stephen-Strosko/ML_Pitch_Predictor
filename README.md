# ML_Pitch_Predictor
Hello everyone and welcome to my code repository that looks to predict pitches that are thrown by major league pitchers. Thanks to an awesome scrapper/api called pybaseball written by James LeDoux, individual pitch data is easy to import and provides rich data that is just waiting to be explored. The goal of this repository is to provide Jupyter Notebooks that have skeleton code that allow users to expore and build on top of my pitch prediction models. Anyone with a basic understanding of Python will be able to use these notebooks to predict pitches for their favorite MLB pitchers.

I encourage anyone that finds these notebooks interesting to jump in and add to this repository. I would love to see a community develop here around pitching data and machine learning.
